### Hi!

I'm Philipp, a computer science researcher and software engineer from Potsdam, Germany.

Some of the projects I contributed to:

- üìê [Projekt Euler](https://github.com/projekteuler/projekteuler) (creator and main contributor)
  - I love the maths puzzle site [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net). Projekt Euler is built on Ruby on Rails, and can be found at [projekteuler.de](https://projekteuler.de). It allows visitors to translate and view the puzzles in German.
- üç¥ [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) (contributor)
  - This self-hosted recipe cookbook is a great project, and I am a happy user. Whenever I find some time, I love to contribute. For example, I added i18n, improved typescript usage, and updated Nuxt and Vue dependencies.
- üåç [Pontoon](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon) (contributor)
  - This project drives the localization website used for all Mozilla projects, including Firefox and Thunderbird. As a Firefox localizer (German), I got to use the project, and started contributing. For example, I executed major dependency updates (including Django) and cleaned up leftover Python 2 code.
